<p>I like working with my hands and trying out different materials. I spend most of the time sculpting, drawing with charcoal, or painting with oil pastels. I'm not always looking for a perfect result; I'm more interested in the process, the mistakes, and the changes that occur while I'm creating something. So, in this course, I want to create a website where I can share my work and, mostly, the process behind it. I think showing how a piece is made is just as important as showing the final result.</p>
