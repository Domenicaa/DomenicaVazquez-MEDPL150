      In her article “With ‘AI slop’ distorting our reality, the world is sleepwalking into disaster,” Nesrine Malik points out the large amount of content generated by artificial intelligence—images, videos, and texts—which she calls “AI slop.” This term refers to the empty and repetitive content consumed on social media and how it desensitizes consumers to what is happening in the real world.
Malik argues that this material is distorting our perception of reality, as the images appear authentic but are fabrications that mix truth and fiction, making it difficult to distinguish between the two. In addition, AI-generated content uses pre-existing data that is biased against ethnic diversity, gender roles, and sexual orientation, reinforcing conservative ideas and stereotypes. 
Social media prioritizes this content to keep its users engaged. For Malik, this phenomenon is not a mistake, but a direct consequence of the internet's economic model. She warns that if we continue to consume “AI slop” without questioning it, we will end up accepting an artificial world as if it were real.
