  <h4>With ‘AI slop’ distorting our reality, the world is sleepwalking into disaster</h4>
       <p>
      In her article “With ‘AI slop’ distorting our reality, the world is sleepwalking into disaster,” Nesrine Malik points out the large amount of content generated by artificial intelligence—images, videos, and texts—which she calls “AI slop.” This term refers to the empty and repetitive content consumed on social media and how it desensitizes consumers to what is happening in the real world.
Malik argues that this material is distorting our perception of reality, as the images appear authentic but are fabrications that mix truth and fiction, making it difficult to distinguish between the two. In addition, AI-generated content uses pre-existing data that is biased against ethnic diversity, gender roles, and sexual orientation, reinforcing conservative ideas and stereotypes. 
Social media prioritizes this content to keep its users engaged. For Malik, this phenomenon is not a mistake, but a direct consequence of the internet's economic model. She warns that if we continue to consume “AI slop” without questioning it, we will end up accepting an artificial world as if it were real.

  <h4>Tetteh: The prisoner ‘My punishment’</h4> 
        <p>
      Tetteh: The Prisoner, tells the story of a woman, who has been a victim of domestic violence, and ended up killing her husband in self-defense.
The illustrations help show the emotions of the characters, like Tetteh’s fear or her husbands’ anger. And they help provide context about Tetteh’s life by showing the slums she lives in, etc. Using photographs instead of illustration would have made it look like the story had actors in it and less believable, so the readers’ perception of what is happening would have been different.
However, by putting a photo and video at the end of the comic, it is easier to understand how serious this situation is. After reading the comic, which is more emotionally charged and symbolically represented, the real images make you remember that stories of women being abused are not just made-up stories, but real-life problems that women face. This helps to create a sense of urgency for the reader.
