            I masked three mountains and blended them with the ocean. Then, I cut out a picture of my eye using the Polygonal Lasso Tool to simulate fish. Finally, I grouped the eyes in a folder so that my edits would affect them equally.
            At first, I edited the photos without any specific message in mind, but later I realized this collage can be interpreted differentlyâ€”the eyes, instead of fish, give a strong impression that they are watching us. They seem conscious, reminding us that as humans, we should be more sensitive toward nature.
